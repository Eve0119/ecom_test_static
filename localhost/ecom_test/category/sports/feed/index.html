										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is almost here. That means clear roads and sidewalks, warmer weather, and a good opportunity to pick up a new pair of running shoes to replace your worn-out trainers from last year. Whether you’re&nbsp;<a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a62953139/how-to-start-running-program/">taking your first strides as a runner</a>&nbsp;or you’ve been at it for decades, there’s a perfect running shoe for every person and we’re here to help you find it.</p><p>Of course, that “perfect shoe” is different for every person. You need to find the right pair for you, and that depends on a variety of factors, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a37134531/how-to-fix-your-running-gait/">your gait</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a61897390/pace-vs-feel-running/">your pace</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20827550/train-on-different-surfaces-to-avoid-injury-and-boost-performance/">where you run</a>, and more.

From workhorse trainers to elite racing shoes and sturdy trail sneakers, these are the models the&nbsp;<em>RW</em>&nbsp;team (including editorial staff, freelance contributors, and wear testers) love the most. No matter where you’re at in your running journey, there’s a pair here that’ll work well for you.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Best Running Shoes</h2><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Best Overall: </strong>Brooks Ghost 16 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Mens-Ghost-Neutral-Running/dp/B0CGY745NW/?linkCode=ogi&amp;tag=runnersworld-auto-20&amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2142.a.19663621%5Bsrc%7Cwww.bing.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C%5Bpid%7C0f4ddd1f-83bf-45b7-b8ae-3da964a70856%5Baxid%7C8b1f152e-859e-4785-a95a-095abfffaf20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Men&#8217;s</a>/<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Womens-Coconut-Chateau-Medium/dp/B0CLMP93TL/?linkCode=ogi&amp;tag=runnersworld-auto-20&amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2142.a.19663621%5Bsrc%7Cwww.bing.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C%5Bpid%7Cdbd46b92-8dd6-498e-bfaa-b5885d772f48%5Baxid%7C55e073ba-7261-475f-a27f-b7ba7c41472e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Women&#8217;s</a>)</li>

Then,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/best-basketballs-4176913#toc-how-we-selected-the-best-basketballs"><strong>we researched dozens of options</strong></a>&nbsp;from top, trusted sports brands.

Depending on their design and materials, they fall into one of three categories:</p><ul id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Indoor basketballs:</strong>&nbsp;Balls designed exclusively for indoor use are typically constructed from real or composite leather. This results in a grippier ball that feels nice to the touch, but these balls are generally less durable when exposed to the hasher conditions of outdoor play.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Outdoor basketballs:</strong>&nbsp;Typically made from rubber, outdoor balls are more durable and resilient to handle harsher play on concrete and dirt and in various weather conditions. These basketballs are often bouncier than their indoor counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Indoor-outdoor basketballs:</strong>&nbsp;Many basketballs are versatile enough for both indoor and outdoor use. Importantly, indoor-outdoor basketballs typically feature designs that are suitable for outdoor play (like a rubber construction). This implies that most outdoor basketballs can be comfortably used indoors, but the reverse may not hold true.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
