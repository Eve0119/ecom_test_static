Depending on their design and materials, they fall into one of three categories:<\/p><ul id=\"mntl-sc-block_5-0\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Indoor basketballs:<\/strong>&nbsp;Balls designed exclusively for indoor use are typically constructed from real or composite leather. This results in a grippier ball that feels nice to the touch, but these balls are generally less durable when exposed to the hasher conditions of outdoor play.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Outdoor basketballs:<\/strong>&nbsp;Typically made from rubber, outdoor balls are more durable and resilient to handle harsher play on concrete and dirt and in various weather conditions. These basketballs are often bouncier than their indoor counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Indoor-outdoor basketballs:<\/strong>&nbsp;Many basketballs are versatile enough for both indoor and outdoor use. Importantly, indoor-outdoor basketballs typically feature designs that are suitable for outdoor play (like a rubber construction). This implies that most outdoor basketballs can be comfortably used indoors, but the reverse may not hold true.<\/li><\/ul>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dribbling, shooting, and making that perfect swish come down to choosing the right ball.
